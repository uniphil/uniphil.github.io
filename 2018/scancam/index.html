      <h1>Scancam</h1>

      <p>Scancam is a slit-scan instant camera. One vertical column of pixels from a small camera module is sent continuously to a thermal receipt printer. It is an experiment in perspective.</p>

      </p>

      <p>The basic parts include a very small thermal receipt printer, a battery holder, switching power regulator, small raspberry pi comptuter, and camera module.</p>

      <p>The videos above show one of the first tests with the original prototype, and a test of an installation idea: capturing street-level views of city blocks and recreating them in space that you can move around in.</p>

      <p>Standing in one place and slowly turning rotating the camera from left to right captures images with a single-point perspective. They look pretty normal, except for the distortions created by hand-holding.

      <p>
        <img
          alt="My house, captured from single-point perspective"
          width="1200"
          src="house.jpg"
        />
      </p>

      <p>If the camera moves while capturing the image, the single-point perspective is lost. The following was captured by pointing scancam at the centre of a tree, and walking one full rotation around it.</p>

      <p>
        <img
          alt="distorted projection of a tree"
          width="1200"
          src="tree.jpg"
        />
      </p>

      <p>Holding the camera's orientation constant and moving it horizontally captures orthographic projections of a scene on th x-axis. This image of a ukulele was captured with that technique:</p>

      <p>
        <img
          alt="a ukulele"
          width="1200"
          src="uke.jpg"
        />
      </p>

      <p>This self-portrait maintains the single-point perspective, but the camera was held sideways, to scan vertically instead of horizontally:</p>

      <p>
        <img
          alt="self-portrait"
          width="1200"
          src="vertical-scan-self-portrait.jpg"
        />
      </p>

      <p>After some hand-held and long-board-gliding tests (thanks Jill!), I mounted scancam on my bike rack, in order to capture continous street-level views of neighbourhoods.</p>

      <p>
        <img
          alt="barrie street"
          width="1200"
          src="bike-mount.jpg"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          alt="The Store Famous on barrie street"
          width="1200"
          src="streetview-barrie.jpg"
        />
      </p>

      <p>Since scancam is slow, I have to ride as slow as I can, which makes it hard to balance, so the distortions can be pretty drastic. The image still usually comes through though, sometimes including bits of text on store signs.</p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>And sometimes the wind feeds my streamer of rendered street-view image into the drive-train of my bike. My friend Syd suggests that I'm &ldquo;integrating mediums with process&rdquo; :)</p>
