        <p>[...] but it was only in the mid-50s when I began to see these devices that it became clear that there were great possibilities for developing animation machines that would manipulate design in ways that could never be done by hand.</p>

      <p>When Whitney says 'these devices', he is talking about antiaircraft gun directors from World War II.</p>

      <p><img alt="WWII-era gun director, appearing as a labeled, large cubic metal box with many knobs, guages, and adjustments, and a very steampunk scope on top." height="688" width="560" src="m7-director.jpg" /></p>

      <p>An antiaircraft gun director aims a gun, given a few inputs like altitude and speed, at an aircraft. The operator simply points the gunsight directly at where the target is <em>now</em>; the machine computes how far ahead to aim the projectile.</p>

      <p>In the 1950s, John Whitney repurposed an M5 (and later an M7) antiaircraft gun director to precisely control camera and subject motions for film, creating groud-breaking animations.</p>

      <p>During this period he also directed engineering films on guided missiles, which leads me to interpret his work more as a celebration of the tools of war than as a tale of Swords to Ploughshares or in any way subversive. So, inspired by Whitney, I used a tool of art to create a tool of war.</p>

      <p>My antiaircraft gun director is modelled after Whitney's M5, with gravity and aircraft altitude and speed acurately modelled. Height and speed are input by tracking an aircraft with the mouse.</p>
