      <h1>Though Process</h1>

      <p>A series using computation as a metaphor for human thought: bare computers work through events from my past, and the processing is made visible as the exposed electronics are touched.</p>

      <p>The tiny screen of ‘am i gay?’ prompts visitors to activate its hand-made copper touch sensor. In response, it displays the binary, rigidly algorithmic way I used to question my own sexuality.</p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>The text for the second part, ‘yay brain’, indirectly emerges from continued interaction with its exploded MIDI keyboard. The content comes from documents written in 2012 while experiencing what I now understand as anxiety attacks, attempting to understand them.</p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>There is one more piece planned for the series, which I expect to complete in early 2019.</p>
