      <h2>Statement</h2>

      <p>I am a Kingston-based queer artist thinking about how to challenge ingrained cultural norms that touch my own experiences. My work is not only a means of introspection, but an invitation for others to see, relate to, and question pieces of ourselves that are not easy to share. I primarily use music, software, and electronic hardware to reflect on experiences of mental health and sexuality.</p>
