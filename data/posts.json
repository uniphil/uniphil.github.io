I want to generate pages that don't necessarily have a 1-to-1 correspondence with source files. I don't just want to make a blog. I want to generate a website. So out the window go nearly all the generators: jekyll, pelican, ...</p>\n<p>I can make metalsmith do this, even if the convention of calling documents in the pipeline \"files\" makes me feel like breaking the one-file-in one-file-out is doing it wrong. So I'm half-way.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"It all sucks. This image doesn't make a lot of sense\" src=\"sucks.jpg\" title=\"This image does not make sense.

I haven't seen it yet.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"This sucks too, probably\" src=\"this-sucks.jpg\" title=\"Lets be honest.
