  <h1>Static Websites Suck</h1>
  <p>Or at least, all of the generators do. At a glance, <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">metalsmith</a> seems like it might kind of suck a little less, but even it sucks.</p>
<p><img alt="Arg" src="arg.jpg" title="This is how I feel about all the generators" /></p>
<p>I don't just want to build a blog. I want to generate pages that don't necessarily have a 1-to-1 correspondence with source files. I don't just want to make a blog. I want to generate a website. So out the window go nearly all the generators: jekyll, pelican, ...</p>
<p>I can make metalsmith do this, even if the convention of calling documents in the pipeline "files" makes me feel like breaking the one-file-in one-file-out is doing it wrong. So I'm half-way.</p>
<p><img alt="It all sucks. This image doesn't make a lot of sense" src="sucks.jpg" title="This image does not make sense. But it's from here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/astroguy/3405778334" /></p>
<p>How about static and binary files? Well metalsmith seems to suck here too. Perhaps it just needs the right plugin. I haven't seen it yet.</p>
<p><img alt="This sucks too, probably" src="this-sucks.jpg" title="Lets be honest. Image used without permission, stolen from: http://www.flickr.com/photos/beefranck/2204552996" /></p>
<p>So I'm making this (yet unnamed) static framework. It will probably suck too. But hey, maybe it will be fun to try.</p>
