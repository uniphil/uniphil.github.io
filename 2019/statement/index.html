      <h2>Statement</h2>

      <p>I am a queer artist, facilitator, and recovering software developer, thinking about how to challenge cultural narratives that touch my own experiences. My work is not only a means of introspection, but an invitation for others to see, relate to, and question pieces of ourselves that are not easy to share. I primarily use music, software, and electronic hardware to reflect on experiences of mental health and sexuality.</p>

      <p>After 10 years in the startup and tech industry I attended the <a href="http://sfpc.io" target="_blank">School For Poetic Computation</a> and have since focused on art and education. My project <a href="https://onesandzeros.ca/">Ones and Zeros</a> introduces electronics and coding through workshops with a critical historical lens and focus on creativity. The aim is to welcome people who arenâ€™t always made to feel welcome in tech spaces.</p>
