      <h1>Virtual DOM is not a feature</h1>
      <p>This is a blog post came from building a tiny dependency-free prototyping-oriented react-inspired javascript <a title="xxs" href="https://github.com/uniphil/xxs">framework</a> (because that's exactly what the world needs more of, right?).</p>
      <p>React's Virtual DOM is sold as an optimization bolted onto a declarative UI to make it fast. I tried to build the slow version, and learned that Virtual DOM is not an optimization, but rather a foundational building block for declarative UIs on the web.</p>

      <h2>A Declarative UI</h2>
      <p><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is popular tool for building web application User Interfaces ("UIs" or "Views"). With React, developers write code that declaratively specifies what the UI should look like at any given point, without worrying about how to change the interface between states.</p>
      <p>Here's a React component:</p>
      <textarea id="compare-react">
const Button = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { count: 0 };
  },
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  },
  render() {
    return React.createElement('button',
      { onClick: this.handleClick },
      `I have been clicked ${this.state.count} times.`);
  },
});

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(Button),
  document.getElementById('react-demo-app'));</textarea>
      <div class="demo">
        <code>#react-demo-app</code>
        <div id="react-demo-app">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>What's notable about React code is what it doesn't do. The above code says nothing about how to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>append DOM nodes,</li>
        <li>attach event listeners,</li>
        <li>change a DOM node's text content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&hellip;so this is cool. React components just "re-render" themselves any time their state changes, and React takes care of updating the DOM for you.</p>
      <p>React is fast because it uses a lightweight javascript representation of the DOM called a Virtual DOM to compute what has changed, and tries to touch the real DOM as little as possible when bringing it up to date. Changing the DOM is slow.</p>

      <h2>Attempting to achieve a declarative UI the slow way</h2>
      <p>The DOM may be slow, but what happens if we ignore that and just delete the whole DOM and make a new one from scratch instead of messing around with Virtual DOMs? Can we get a declarative UI that works like React but slower?</p>
      <p>Here is my attempt:</p>

      <textarea id="replace-dom-clickcount">
// Helper: DOM Node factory
function d(tagName, events, children) {
  const el = document.createElement(tagName);
  Object.keys(events).forEach(evt =>
    el.addEventListener(evt, events[evt]));
  children.forEach(child => el.appendChild(child));
  return el;
}
// Helper: Text node factory
function t(content) {
  return document.createTextNode(content);
}

// Global state woo!
var clickCount = 0;

// Handle state change and re-render
function increment() {
  clickCount += 1;
  replaceDOM();
}

// Our declarative button component:
const Button = () =>
  d('button', { click: () => increment() }, [
    t(`I've been clicked ${clickCount} times.`),
  ]);

// All the gory DOM stuff
const root = document.getElementById('replace-dom-app');
function replaceDOM() {
  // blow away the current DOM
  while (root.lastChild) root.removeChild(root.lastChild);
  // and replace it with a new DOM
  root.appendChild(Button());
}

// kick things off (we need a first render)
replaceDOM();</textarea>
      <div class="demo">
        <code>#replace-dom-app</code>
        <div id="replace-dom-app"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Seems to work!</p>

      <h3>So, React in 30 lines?</h3>
      <p>There's a big problem with this technique, already showing in the click-counting button example above. See it? It's more obvious if we try to render a text input:</p>
      <textarea id="replace-dom-charcount">
// A declarative character-counting text input component
const CharCounter = () =>
  d('div', {}, {}, [
    d('input', {
      value: inputText
    }, {
      input: e => setText(e.target.value)
    }, []),
    t(`You have entered ${inputText.length} characters`),
  ]);

var inputText = '';

// state updater and re-rendering
function setText(text) {
  inputText = text;
  replaceDOM();
}

// DOM stuff:
function d(tagName, attrs, events, children) {
  const el = document.createElement(tagName);
  Object.keys(attrs).forEach(atr => el[atr] = attrs[atr]);
  // ^^ see postscript for tricky attribute edge-case
  Object.keys(events).forEach(evt =>
    el.addEventListener(evt, events[evt]));
  children.forEach(child => el.appendChild(child));
  return el;
}
function t(content) { return document.createTextNode(content); }
const root = document.getElementById('charcount-app');
function replaceDOM() {
  while (root.lastChild) root.removeChild(root.lastChild);
  root.appendChild(CharCounter());
}
replaceDOM();</textarea>
      <div class="demo">
        <code>#charcount-app</code>
        <div id="charcount-app"></div>
      </div>

      <p>After you enter each character, the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> you're typing in gets deleted. It's replaced with a new one, and your cursor is not focused on it. Same with the click-counting <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>: if you focus it and try to activate it multiple times with the space-bar, you'll find that you lose the button focus after each activation.</p>

      <h3>Refresh vs. Update Semantics</h3>
      <p>The broken demos above work correctly as specified, but they are unusable and feel broken because the semantics are wrong. Deleting the DOM and making a new one is like a page-refresh, so all transient UI state like <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, and even scroll position, are lost along with the DOM. Just like in a page-refresh.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>When the data changes, React conceptually hits the "refresh" button, and knows to only update the changed parts.</p>
        <cite>&ndash; <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html#declarative">Why React</a> from the React documentation</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Re-rendering in React is not like a page refresh</strong>, because none of that transient state is lost. The DOM is <strong>just mutated</strong>.</p>
      <p>Does this difference in semantics matter? Probably not. Even React's own documentation gets it wrong. But thanks for reading anyway :)</p>
      <h2>If not the Virtual DOM, what is the feature that makes React fast?</h2>
      <p>React components render a _description_ of what the DOM should look like, called the Virtual DOM. What I've learned is that Virtual DOM is an implementation detail of creating a declarative UI library, not an optimization.</p>
      <p>Reacts killer speed feature is its nifty <strong>algorithms that operate on</strong> the Virtual DOM in order to quickly compute a sufficient but small number of DOM mutations to perform on the actual page to bring it up to date. That's it!</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading. Let me know what you think, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/uncyclephil">@uncyclephil</a> on twitter.</p>
      <p>If I get around to it or if someone is interested, I've got a post in mind about another tricky problem for declarative web UIs: correctly dealing with recursive state updates triggered by DOM updates. Sounds so exciting I know&hellip;</p>

    </div>
    <div class="postscripts">

      <h3>Postscript: The ugly <code>Element.setAttribute</code> special case: <code>value</code></h3>
      <p>Most HTML attributes can be set on DOM elements via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute"><code>Element.setAttribute(attrName, value)</code></a>, but unfortunately, <code>value</code> is special, and can't be set in this way. It has to be assigned to the element directly instead (<code>el.value = 'some text'</code> instead of <code>el.setAttribute('value', 'some text')</code>). The example code in the post ignores this special case for clarity. As far as I can find, <code>value</code> is the only special attribute that can't be assigned via <code>Element.setAttribute</code>. Friends, the web platform!</p>
      <p>Special-case handling for looping <code>attrs</code> might look like this:</p>
      <textarea id="ps">
attrs.forEach(attr =>
  attr === 'value'
    ? el = attrs[attr]
    : el.setAttribute(attr, attrs[attr]));</textarea>

      <h3>Post-postscript: Can we get page-refresh semantics if we exhaustively declare even transient state?</h3>
      <p>The problem with the blow-the-dom-away approach above was that we lost transient state like <code>:focus</code> (that we might not want to track ourselves) every time we replaced the DOM. While writing this post, it occurred to me: what if did track and control all that extra state?</p>
      <p>Starting with <code>focus</code>:</p>
      <textarea id="controlled-focus">
// An element if one wants to be ref-focused after DOM replacement
var toFocus = null;

// a DOM factory that knows how to ask for focus after rendering
function d(tagName, attrs, focus, events, children) {
  const el = document.createElement(tagName);
  Object.keys(attrs).forEach(atr => el[atr] = attrs[atr]);
  Object.keys(events).forEach(evt => el.addEventListener(evt, events[evt]));
  children.forEach(child => el.appendChild(child));
  if (focus) toFocus = el;  // should probably validate that we aren't trying to focus > 1 el in a render
  return el;
}
function t(content) { return document.createTextNode(content); }

var isReplacingDOM = false;  // a guard so we can ignore focus/blur events during our update

var isFocused = false;
var inputText = '';

// A helper to ensure a guarded re-render after state updates
const updater = fn => function(/* arguments */) {
  if (!isReplacingDOM) {
    fn.apply(null, arguments);
    replaceDOM();
  }
}

// state updaters
const focusInput = updater(() => isFocused = true);
const blurInput = updater(() => isFocused = false);
const changeText = updater(newValue => inputText = newValue);


const CharCounter = () =>
  d('div', {}, false, {}, [
    d('input', {
      value: inputText,
    },
    isFocused,
    {
      input: e => changeText(e.target.value),
      focus: () => focusInput(),
      blur: () => blurInput(),
    }, []),
    t(`You have entered ${inputText.length} characters`),
  ]);


const root = document.getElementById('controlled-focus-app');
function replaceDOM() {
  // guard against focus/blur events triggered by adding/removing dom nodes triggering state updates
  isReplacingDOM = true;
  // blow away the current DOM
  while (root.lastChild) root.removeChild(root.lastChild);
  // and replace it with a new DOM
  root.appendChild(CharCounter());
  // restore focus state
  if (toFocus) toFocus.focus();
  // and reset
  toFocus = false;
  // re-enable state updates
  isReplacingDOM = false;
}

      <p>Hey now we are getting somewhere! This is a declarative UI with close to page-refresh semantics, no Virtual DOM, and it seems to work!</p>
      <p>This may be an interesting avenue to exploring other simplicity-over-efficiency frameworks for declarative UIs. However some immediate weaknesses jump out at me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a lot more more tricky state to manage (<code>toFocus</code> and <code>isReplacingDOM</code> for starters).</li>
        <li>It may be difficult to correctly manage all state-related events resulting from DOM changes, like a <code>blur</code> event triggered by removing an <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> that had focus. Or should these events all be silenced if we're really going for page-refresh semantics?</li>
        <li>Components must declare more state &ndash; actually maybe not an awful thing, but definitely an extra burden for building prototypes quickly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These don't sound like impossible challenges to me, but I think that implementing a Virtual DOM is actually possible with a simpler implementation than solving these problems would require, so that's that path I'm currently sticking to.
